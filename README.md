This repository contains my solutions and code for the Machine Learning assignment from [Alexey Grigorev](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev) for the program, [ML Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp). 

The course focused on 
1. Introduction to Machine learning
2. ML vs Rule-Based Systems
3. Supervised Machine Learning
4. CRISP-DM
5. Model Selection Process
6. Refresher on Numpy, Pandas, and Linear Algebra
7. Implementation of Linear Regression, classification, data preprocessing, etc.

Each notebook or script corresponds to a specific part of the assignment, and I have provided the questions/explanations and comments to clarify the code and approach used.

Feel free to explore the code and solutions, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement. 

This project is part of my ongoing learning journey in the field of Machine Learning, and I hope it can be helpful to others interested in similar topics.
